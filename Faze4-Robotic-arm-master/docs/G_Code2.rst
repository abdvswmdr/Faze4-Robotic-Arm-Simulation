High level code
===========================

.. meta::
   :description lang=en: info about Code.
   
High level code does all calculations and simulations. It will usually run on the PC since it will be doing a lot of
math and matrix multiplications. It will use some kind of inverse kinematics solver that will generate joint angles and speeds.
Again, gross simplification, but we will talk more about it later.

All code is in github repository.
