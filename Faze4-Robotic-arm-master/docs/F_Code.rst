Low level code
===========================

.. meta::
   :description lang=en: info about Code.
   
Code for this robotic arm can be devided in 2 parts:

* Low level code
* High level code

Low level code is code that runs on our microcontroller (in our case teensy 3.5).
Its main purpose is to receive information from high level code and transform that information 
into useful signals for stepper drivers. That is a gross simplification, but codes used 
will be explained in more detail below.

All code is in github repository.
